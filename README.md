# Auto-growing Textarea Challenge

In this challenge, there is a bug in our existing `AutoHeightTextarea` component. Your task is to find out why and fix it! ðŸ’ª

## Requirements

1. Currently the textarea adjusts it's height correctly when the user types in it.
2. BUT if the parent component provides a new value via v-model the height isn't updated properly
3. You should ensure the textarea adjusts it's height even when the parent updates the value
